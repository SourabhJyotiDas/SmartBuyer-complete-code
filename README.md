## üöÄ About Me
 MERN-STACK DEVELOPER üë®‚Äçüíª


# SmartBuyer ( A MERN-Stack e-commerce project)

Hi! My name is Sourabh Jyoti Das, I have created this web application.

Welcome to SmartBuyer, your one-stop destination for all your online shopping needs. We have created a seamless shopping experience by leveraging cutting-edge technologies to provide you with a user-friendly and secure platform.

At the heart of our website, we have used Node.js and Express.js to build a robust and scalable backend. The powerful MongoDB database ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling fast and seamless transactions. With the integration of Stripe, a leading payment gateway, we guarantee secure and hassle-free online payments, providing peace of mind to our customers.

On the frontend, we have employed React.js, a popular JavaScript library, to deliver a smooth and interactive user interface. React Router DOM allows for seamless navigation across different pages, ensuring a fluid browsing experience. We have implemented React Redux and Redux Thunk to efficiently manage the application's state, enabling smooth data flow and enhanced performance. Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring fast and reliable data transfers.

To enhance the visual appeal of our website, we have incorporated Chart.js, a powerful charting library, to present data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. React Icons, React Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS provide a wide range of icons, UI components, and customizable styles to create a beautiful and responsive design. We have also utilized React Toastify, an elegant notification library, to provide informative and user-friendly alerts.

For an enhanced shopping experience, we have implemented React Multi Carousel, which allows for dynamic and interactive product carousels, enabling easy product discovery. Additionally, our website supports location-based features with the help of Country-State-City, which provides accurate and up-to-date information on countries, states, and cities.

To provide feedback and rate products, we have integrated React Rating Stars, empowering customers to express their opinions and contribute to the community. Finally, we have optimized the development process using Redux DevTools Extension, enabling efficient debugging and monitoring of the application's state.

## Install Dependencies

ENJOY üçâ
